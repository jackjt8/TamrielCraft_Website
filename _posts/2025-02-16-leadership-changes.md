## Tribunal Transition

On February 16th, 2025, **CaptumQuantum** officially stepped down from his position as a member of the Tribunal. After much discussion, CaptumQuantum chose to step back from this leadership role to focus on other priorities, but he remains part of the team as **Staff** — and has made it clear that he’s happy to step in again when needed.

We want to thank CaptumQuantum for his invaluable leadership, insight, and dedication during his time on the Tribunal. His influence has shaped many areas of the server and his continued presence on the team is deeply appreciated.


## A New Tribunal Member

Following CaptumQuantum's departure, we’re pleased to announce that **Dee** has been promoted from Staff to Tribunal.

Dee has been a cornerstone of TamrielCraft’s progress for many years, contributing an incredible number of high-quality builds — especially across **Solstheim** and **Vvardenfell**. Many iconic locations owe their form to Dee’s work, including:

- **Old Ebonheart** (inspired by *The Elder Scrolls Online*)  
- **Skaal Village**  
- **Pelagiad**  
- **Molag Mar**  
- **Davon’s Watch**  
- **Seyda Neen**  
- **Ald Sotha**

These are just a few of the many places shaped by Dee’s creativity and attention to detail. Their ability to balance lore fidelity with practical in-world design has helped breathe life into some of the most beloved (and obscure) corners of Morrowind. As Tribunal, we know Dee will bring the same vision and drive to guiding the project as a whole.

Please join us in congratulating Dee on this well-earned promotion!


## Staff Promotion

We’re also proud to welcome **Nat** to the Staff team.

Over the past few years, Nat has become a dependable and friendly presence on the server — frequently helping new players, sharing insight, and assisting when other staff weren't around. Their quiet reliability has made them an essential part of our day-to-day community.

In addition to moderation and support, Nat has contributed to a wide variety of builds across Tamriel. Some notable examples include:

- **Anvil Castle**  
- **Necrom**  
- A number of **Dunmer ancestral tombs**  
- **Nchuleftingth**  
- **Bthuand**  
- The **Keywright’s Gallery**

Nat's fingerprints are all over the world — often in areas where thoughtful, atmospheric design is key. With Dee’s move to Tribunal, the time felt right to officially bring Nat onto the Staff team.

TamrielCraft is a community-driven project, and it's people like CaptumQuantum, Dee, and Nat who help keep it alive — one build, one conversation, and one idea at a time. Thank you all for being part of this journey and we hope you'll join us as we pave the road ahead!
