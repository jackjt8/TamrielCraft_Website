If you've run into strange issues on the server lately—lag spikes, terrain glitches, chunks failing to load, or even getting kicked offline—you’re not the only one. We know things have been rocky, and we want to shed some light on what’s causing the instability—and why we believe it’s worth pushing through.

## The Vision, Years in the Making

Nearly ten years ago, one of our most dedicated builders, Fonta59, began a monumental undertaking: recreating Skyrim as faithfully as possible, block by block. His goal was to match the world seen in The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim with near 1:1 accuracy—capturing its geography, settlements, and atmosphere in painstaking detail. What started as a standalone passion project soon grew into a parallel build effort alongside the main TamrielCraft map.

> You can actually download and play on Fonta59's version of Skyrim over on [PlanetMinecraft](https://www.planetminecraft.com/project/skyrim-map-by-fonta59-skyrim-tes-interiors-with-download-1-20/).

Some of Fonta’s work has made it into the live server over the years—cities like **Whiterun**, **Solitude**, and **Winterhold** are already familiar to long-time players. But a huge chunk of the project remained separate. The reason? The terrain and scale tweaks were so extensive that integrating the full build would have required massive changes to our existing map.

**Until now.**


## What’s Happening Behind the Scenes

Fonta is currently in the process of merging his entire overhauled Skyrim into the main TamrielCraft world. This includes:

- Major **terrain overhauls** across the province  
- Integration of **unreleased cities, towns, and ruins**  
- Adjustments to **elevation, roads, rivers, and borders** for better regional cohesion

This kind of integration is... well, monumental. It requires hours of world editing, careful alignment, and no small amount of server resources. As we blend old and new, some side effects—like lag spikes, terrain anomalies, or visual bugs—are to be expected.

Because Fonta’s project developed independently from the main server, there are areas where his builds now overlap with existing ones already present on TamrielCraft. In these cases, we’re engaging in detailed discussions as a team to decide which version to keep. Fonta’s builds naturally align with the new terrain—while our existing ones were shaped by the old geography and often require reworking to fit.

These aren’t easy decisions. Whether it’s a village, a fort, or an entire region, we approach each case carefully, striving to honour the work of all contributors. TamrielCraft has always been a collaborative effort, and that spirit of shared vision continues to guide us—even as the world shifts beneath our feet.


## Why It Matters

Despite the disruption, this is one of the most exciting milestones in TamrielCraft's history.

We’re working toward a version of Skyrim that feels immersive, cohesive, and true to the source material. Every hold, road, and mountain pass is being recreated with immense care and detail—lovingly crafted, block by block, to capture the spirit and scale of the original.


## Looking Ahead

We want to thank everyone for their patience while we carry out this massive update. We’re working hard to minimize downtime and ensure the world remains stable as we go.

And most of all, thank you to **Fonta** for his years of tireless work, and to **every builder, contributor, and supporter** helping bring Tamriel to life—one block at a time.

Stay tuned... the best is yet to come.
