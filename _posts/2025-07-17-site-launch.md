## A Long-Overdue Update

Welcome to the new TamrielCraft website!

Our previous site hadn’t seen a meaningful update since 2017. It was maintained by a single team member, which made it difficult to keep information current or share progress with the broader community. As the project grew, so did the need for a more flexible, team-friendly platform.

## Why a New Site — and Why Now?

TamrielCraft has changed a lot over the years. We've grown from a handful of builders into a vibrant team recreating an entire continent. With that growth comes more updates, more contributors, and more need for transparency, accessibility, and regular communication. Our old site just couldn’t keep up.

This relaunch is more than a visual facelift — it’s a shift in how we share and build together.

## Built for the Community

Our new site is powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a lightweight static site generator that transforms simple Markdown files into fully functional web pages. Markdown is the same formatting used on Reddit, Discord, and many forums — so it's easy to write, easy to read, and easy to contribute to.

This approach lets us:

- Write posts and updates in plain text using `.md` files  
- Review and approve content through GitHub pull requests  
- Let multiple team members contribute without needing web development experience  
- Maintain better organization with categories, tags, and archives  

And best of all: since it’s statically generated, the site is fast, secure, and easy to host.

## What's Next?

We plan to use this new platform to post regular updates, tutorials, technical breakdowns, build showcases, and more. Whether you’re a casual explorer, an aspiring builder, or a long-time contributor, this site will be your hub for everything TamrielCraft.

As always, we invite you to [join our Discord](#) to stay up to date, ask questions, or apply to contribute.

Here’s to a new chapter — and a better way to share the world we’re building together.
