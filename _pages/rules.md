## 1. NO ABUSE

This includes any and all forms of insults, flaming, trolling, harassment, and aggressive and disrespectful behaviour. Continued display of offensive behaviours will result in an immediate ban.

## 2. NO GRIEFING OR MODIFICATION OF BUILDS

Malicious destruction or modification of any building projects, items and objects on the server will result in immediate ban. DO NOT alter any build without permission from the assigned builder(s) or server staff, or without submitting an application and getting approval on our forum.

DO NOT use another account to circumvent a ban or other punishment.

## 7. STAFF APPROVAL REQUIRED FOR ALL BUILDS

Explicit permission from TamrielCraft staff is required before building.

## 8. APPLICATIONS BEFORE APPROVAL

You must be granted permission to work on an existing build or create plans for your own project before you will be given Citizen rank.

## 9. STAY WITHIN MAP BOUNDARIES

DO NOT place players, blocks, items, mobs, schematics, or generate new terrain outside of the map area.
