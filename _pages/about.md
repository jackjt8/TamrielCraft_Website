TamrielCraft is an ambitious Minecraft project dedicated to faithfully recreating the continent of Tamriel, from The Elder Scrolls series, and its surrounding isles ‚Äî one block at a time.

## üìú Our Origins

TamrielCraft was founded on **December 25, 2012** and has grown into a dedicated community of builders, lore enthusiasts, and roleplayers. While many members have come and gone, the heart of the project remains: to bring the world of *The Elder Scrolls* to life in Minecraft ‚Äî in both accuracy and spirit.

## üåç The World

The map spans the **entire continent of Tamriel**, including key provinces like Skyrim, Morrowind, and Hammerfell, as well as a few surrounding islands. Build teams work together to create environments that reflect the **in-game depictions**, **written lore**, and **developer comments**, balancing aesthetic cohesion with deep respect for source material.

We are actively updating the world to reflect new content from *The Elder Scrolls Online* while continuing our work on other entries in the series, ensuring TamrielCraft evolves alongside the franchise.

## üõ†Ô∏è How Building Works

TamrielCraft is a greylist server ‚Äî anyone can join and explore freely. However, building privileges are granted only to those who have earned the Builder Rank through an application process on our [Discord community](https://discord.gg/ApShrYn).

Building the continent requires careful planning. Members choose their own locations, but before any construction begins, they must submit a detailed proposal. This typically includes:

- Lore-accurate references and in-game screenshots
- Blocked-out layouts using wool or placeholder blocks
- Block palette samples and plans for deviations from in-game depictions (if necessary)
- When lore is limited, builders often draw upon real-world architecture, history, and cultures to design locations that feel both authentic and consistent with the Elder Scrolls universe

Once submitted, each application is reviewed and voted on by other members to ensure the proposal aligns with the server‚Äôs standards for quality, consistency, and lore accuracy. Only after approval are building permissions granted.
